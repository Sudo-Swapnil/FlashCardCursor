# shadcn UI Usage

This project uses **shadcn UI** for all UI elements.

## Initialization

If shadcn UI is not initialized in the project, use the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

## Adding Components

If a particular component is not installed, use the following command to add it.

**Example:** To install the button component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

Replace `button` with the name of any other component you need (e.g., `card`, `dialog`, `input`, `select`, etc.).

## General Guidelines

- Always use shadcn UI components instead of creating custom UI elements from scratch
- Check if a component is already installed before adding it
- Follow shadcn UI's component structure and conventions
